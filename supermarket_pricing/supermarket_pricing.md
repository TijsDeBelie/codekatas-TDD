# Supermarket Pricing
### all credits to [Dave Thomas](http://codekata.com/kata/kata01-supermarket-pricing/)

The main goal is to solve pricing goods in supermarket.

In the supermarket you can have simple products, costing some value per unit or products that will have it's prices based on weight.
There can also be bundled promotions, meaning you can buy 2 products but pay only for one.

All these logics have to be considered before solving the kata.

You can build a checklist to define what your supermarket will have and what it will not, for example:

> The supermarket will use fractions of money.
> The supermarket can only sell products in unit.
> There will be no bundled promotions.
> A price log will exist to track down the expenses.

Think about what your supermarket will have and how you can handle the logic behind it.
