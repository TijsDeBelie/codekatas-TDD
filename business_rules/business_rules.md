# Business Rules 
#### all credits to [Dave Thomas](http://codekata.com/kata/kata16-business-rules/)

The main goal of this kata is to implement a payment system based on some business rules that can be modified as easily as possible.

- The store currently sells physical books, video-games (online and physical)
- The store has also a optional membership for it's clients
- The membership allows specific discounts for each product sold in the store
- The store will send a 5% commission to the employee that sells a physical product
- The store plans to expand selling also bananas (why not?) and coffee drinks. 
You don't have to implement those yet, but keep in mind that new products can be added to the store
