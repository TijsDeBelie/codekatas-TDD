# Code katas

## Introduction

This is a repository that contains some code katas that can be used for practicing your 
coding skills.

The main idea is not only to code, but to think about the problems and write the 
best code you can write with the main goal of solving a problem.

As written by Dave Thomas in his site, during the process of resolving these katas try to
>- Find a place and time where you wonâ€™t be interrupted
>- Focus on the essential elements of the kata
>- Remember to look for feedback for every major decision
>- If it helps, keep a journal of your progress

And the most important part
> Have discussion groups with other developers, but try to have completed the kata first.
>
> There are no right or wrong answers in these kata: the benefit comes from the process, 
> not from the result.

## Instructions

Each kata will have it's own folder containing a markdown text providing the 
information needed to solve a problem.

Also inside you will find language specific **methods** used to solve a given problem by someone.
Remember, these are only **methods** not **solutions**. You can use them to clarify some parts
and to see other perspectives on the same problem.

**It is very much recommended to make this katas following a Test Driven Development**

If you want to, when you're done you can open a pull request to add your method to this repository.
All languages are accepted.
